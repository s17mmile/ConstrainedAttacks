Roadmap. Be fast.

Write paper while all steps are ongoing.

Write an extensiev README to maybe make the code in this project retain its uselfulness.

1. Implement model teching script, especially to include TopoDNN.
    --> Have ALL of them ready and preprocessed before any more steps are taken.
2. With datasets and helpers having been renamed and shifted around, fix the existing attack scripts.
3. Attack ImageNet with PGD and RDSA. Also attack CIFAR-10 with all.
4. Attack TopoDNN with existing methods, ensure reproducibility.
5. Introduce restrictions.
    --> For topodnn, find some shit that makes sense that isn't just Energy Conservation.
    --> Introduce comparable restrictions for attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to see if their reactions are similar.
    --> Conclusion: does the same restriction applied to the same task produce comparable results?
6. Retrain Models. Evaluate Performance.
