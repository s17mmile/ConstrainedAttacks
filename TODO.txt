Roadmap. Be fast.

Write paper while all steps are ongoing.

Write an extensiev README to maybe make the code in this project retain its uselfulness.

1. ImageNet and MNIST: Save training and testing data separately.
    --> Decide exactly which data should be augmented. 
    --> I would assume we augment the training data while leaving training data unchanged.
    --> Exception for ImageNet, as I cannot find the training data: use one of the three test sets for augmentation, one for evaluation.
2. With datasets and helpers having been renamed and shifted around, fix the existing attack scripts.
    --> Include Memory Mapping!
3. Attack ImageNet with PGD and RDSA. Also attack CIFAR-10 with all.
4. Attack TopoDNN with existing methods, ensure reproducibility.
5. Introduce restrictions.
    --> For topodnn, find some shit that makes sense that isn't just Energy Conservation.
    --> Introduce comparable restrictions for attacks on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet to see if their reactions are similar.
    --> Conclusion: does the same restriction applied to the same task produce comparable results?
6. Retrain Models. Evaluate Performance.
