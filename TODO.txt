- PDG: Make stepsize variable as the algorithm goes along to "zero in" on a solution
- PDG: do we use the gradient sign or the gradient itself?
- PGD: decide if the dfeasibility projection step should occur before the rest.

- Get TopoDNN model
- Get the CMS Dataset used for it
- Implement numpy memory mapping to not eat as much RAM
