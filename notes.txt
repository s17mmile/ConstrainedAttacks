- The dense layer model for MNIST produces "regular" FGSM adversarials.
    --> The softmax-activated maxpool model produces banding on the right and bottom of the image, as the gradient apparently is always positive.
    --> Also, sometimes, the gradients are just zero... everywhere. This may be a result of downsampling in the maxpooling layers and softmax function, as softmax relies on having multiple inputs. 
    --> The zero gradients may just be due to some property of softmax and the repeated maxpooling, which reduces the input count to softmax a lot.

    --> Behaviour is very much dependent on architecture. Not sure if the filter count in the conv2d layers is critical.
    --> I'd have thought it's besser to have it decrease instead of increase throughout the model structure.
