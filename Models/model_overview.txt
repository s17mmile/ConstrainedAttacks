MNIST:
    maxpooled_model: "Regular" MNIST Model using convolution, maxpooling and softmax. Exact same as in the keras mnsit tutorial.
    dense_model: Uses a handful of dense layers - no convolving or pooling. Input shape ist (784,), so flatten examples if you want to ue it.

ImageNet:
    base_model: Pretrained ImageNet v2 model, uses all kinds of different layers.

TopoDNN:
    All these mdoels are pretrained and taken from FAIR4HEP's Top Tagger Repo and converted into .keras format.

CIFAR-10:
    base_model: selft-trained CIFAR model with an architecture expanded from the MNIST Model's layout.
